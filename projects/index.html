                          We celebrated 1st January by giving at least one blanket to someone in need, so they could have dignity. This winter, we committed ourselves to raise resources from our family and friends to make someone's winter a little warmer.<br><br><img src="/assets/fooddrive.jpg" width="100%" alt=""><br>We distributed 100 blankets to the poor people who sleep on the streets of Kolkata, on New Year's night. We would like to specially mention here that everyone donated wholeheartedly when we went to them with our proposal. We are truly very thankful to all who donated and also to all our members, who actively participated in our program. A member of our CC happily offered his car, which eased the process of our distribution. Our work carried on for the whole night, enabling us to give the blankets only to those who were in utmost need of it.<br><br>This program taught us: It is not how much we give, but what matters is how much love we put into giving.
